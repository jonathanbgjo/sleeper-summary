# SuppDawg League Week 6 Recap

Well folks, welcome to another thrilling week of **SupDawg** fantasy football! Week 6 had more surprises than a game of hide and seek with Ryan Leaf. Let‚Äôs break it down.

**Manager of the Week: C.T.Ebo**  
With a jaw-dropping **43.1 points**, C.T.Ebo flexed like a dad at a BBQ, even with Josh Allen just hanging around. **Dallas Goedert** delivered a solid **23.4**, proving that tight ends can score more than just the occasional free pizza at the team meeting.

**Biggest Blowout: C.T.Ebo vs. LISAN**  
C.T.Ebo not only took the crown but also put LISAN on the fantasy ***‚Äúdo not disturb‚Äù*** list, leaving them scoreless. It was like showing up to a potluck with no dish‚Äîawkward and sad all around.

**Heartbreaker of the Week: my gochu is dak dak vs. Warrening, Bowers**  
In a clash that could only be labeled as a battle for the ages, my gochu is dak dak squeaked out a win with **21.4 points**. Meanwhile, Warrening, Bowers took home a big ol' goose egg. Ouch! Someone needs a hug (and maybe a new game plan).

**Bench Oops: 100%‚Ä¶‚Ä¶. Frauds!!**  
Oopsie daisies! While **Jaxson Dart** picked up **26.88 points**, he was busy hanging out on the bench. Who needs a starting QB when you've got the next Tom Brady warming the sidelines, right?

**Trade Fallout:**  
While there were no trades to discuss this week, it seems everyone‚Äôs keeping their cards close to their chests. Remember‚Äîsometimes less is more, kinda like pineapple on pizza. So let‚Äôs see if next week‚Äôs trades can warm things up!

**Waiver Gem: Not Applicable**  
No hidden gems to report this week. But keep those eyes peeled! The waiver wire is like a treasure hunt where the treasure is so hidden, you might need a map (and a good GPS).

That‚Äôs it for this week's festivities! Join us next week to see who manages to turn their luck around and who continues their eternal quest toward the coveted toilet bowl playoffs! üèÜ
