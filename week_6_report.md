# SupDawg League Week 6 Recap

**Manager of the Week:**  
Congratulations to **Cardiac Cats Are Back**, who pulled off a heart-stopping 208.52 points! Looks like their players finally got the memo this week, unlike their livers with all that stress.

**Biggest Blowout:**  
In a matchup that felt about as close as a Kardashian’s Wi-Fi password, **Jewmarr Chase** obliterated **100%……. Frauds!!** with a score of 190.6 to 123.85. That’s what you call a “clutch” performance—not to be confused with a clutch purse!

**Heartbreaker:**  
My sympathies go out to **For Love or the Chase?** with a dismal 108.31 showing. When Sam Darnold outscored your entire starting squad, it’s time to rethink your life choices. Spoiler alert: It involves not starting Sam Darnold.

**Bench Oops:**  
**my gochu is dak dak** might want to spend some time with their bench, where *CeeDee Lamb* and *Justin Jefferson* could have made a fine start. Instead, they played the fantasy equivalent of hide and seek while putting up 0 points. 

**Trade Fallout:**  
Meanwhile, **$70 QB** shrugged off the drama of not trading for a player who then scored 39.24 points. Maybe next time, you’ll try a little less “QB drama” and a little more “decisive trading.” 

**Waiver Gem:**  
Keep an eye on **J.J. McCarthy**—zero points this week, but as we say in the fantasy world, “There's always next week!” Maybe the waiver wire will treat him better?

That’s a wrap for Week 6! Stay tuned for next week’s drama as we find out if our managers are really "on the mend" or just "in denial!" 🏈
