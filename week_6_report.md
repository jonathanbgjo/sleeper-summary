# SupDawg League Week 6 Recap

**Manager of the Week:**  
This week’s crown goes to **C.T.Ebo**! With a whopping **43.1 points**, they managed to outshine the competition like a LED bulb at a candlelit dinner. Big shoutout to that dynamic duo of **Cam Skattebo** and **Dallas Goedert** who combined for over 43 points. I guess they heard "score big or go home!"

**Biggest Blowout:**  
Gold stars to **C.T.Ebo** for steamrolling **LISAN** with a score of **43.1 to 0**. That’s not just a win; it’s a testimony to LISAN’s invisibility. If scoring points were a profession, they’d be unemployed!

---

**Heartbreaker:**  
In a nail-biting matchup, **J.J. McCarthy** and the gang over at **Warrening, Bowers** collectively scored **0** points against **my gochu is dak dak**, who squeaked by with **20.4**. If they were a bakery, they’d be selling the world’s saddest éclairs—plain and empty!

---

**Bench Oops:**  
The whispers in the fantasy wind this week suggest that **For Love or the Chase?** might’ve missed a gem on the bench. Their star **Ja'Marr Chase** could’ve helped his owners avoid landing at the bottom with a big old **0 points** as a starter. Seriously, did ya’ll think zero was the new hero?

---

**Trade Fallout:**  
Well, talk about some awkward post-trade dinner conversation! **J.J. McCarthy** is like that ex who looks great after a breakup. Just look at his clean sheet of **0 points** while sitting on the bench of **Warrening, Bowers**—that’s a real "What could’ve been" scenario.

---

**Waiver Gem:**  
No waiver gems this week, unless you consider it "gem-like" to score **0 points**. Maybe the wire was just a bit dry this week?

So there you have it! As we gear up for next week, remember: It's not just about winning; it’s about how creatively you can lose. See you on the field!
