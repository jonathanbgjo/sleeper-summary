# SupDawg Week 5 Recap: The Weekend Warriors

**Manager of the Week**: ***Jewmarr Chase*** swoops in with 209.69 points! If their performance was a movie, it would be *Gone with the Wind*—a total blowout that left their opponent in the dust. 

**Biggest Blowout**: The aforementioned Jewmarr Chase achieved a comfortable victory over **Herbert Fully Loaded** (171.93) by nearly *38 points*. Perhaps Herbert should consult with their namesake for a reboot.

**Heartbreaker**: **LISAN** put up a respectable 143.62 but fell to **For Love or the Chase?** (156.97). Just when they thought they had a shot, Cooper Rush said, “Not today!” Guess who got benched by the fantasy gods?

**Bench Oops**: The sad story of **Warrening, Bowers** features Jacory Croskey-Merritt, who racked up 29 points while sitting on the bench. Meanwhile, a certain starter only managed a weak 7.08. Oof, that’s what we call a benching faux pas!

**Trade Fallout**: What’s this? Spencer Rattler (sent to **Jewmarr Chase**) submits a fine performance with 21.53 points! Who said trades are just paperwork? Someone’s prepping for a LinkedIn endorsement!

**Waiver Gem**: Early bird gets the worm! **Cardiac Cats Are Back** snagged the Pittsburgh Steelers from waivers just in time. Talk about a power move! 

With Week 6 looming, will *In Goff We Trust* finally break into the win column, or do they need a fantasy exorcist? Stay tuned!
