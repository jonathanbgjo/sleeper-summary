# SupDawg League Week 5 Recap

Welcome back, SupDawgers! Week 5 was a whirlwind of touchdowns, bench blunders, and copious amounts of fantasy anguish. Let's dive into the highlights, lowlights, and all the right bites!

## **Manager of the Week: Jewmarr Chase**
With a staggering **209.69 points**, Jewmarr Chase put the league on notice. If you were wondering where the point factory is located, it‚Äôs right here! Matthew Stafford tossed a juicy **35.11 points** while Jonathan Taylor galloped to **31.6**, leaving his competition in the dust.

## **Biggest Blowout: Jewmarr Chase vs. Herbert Fully Loaded**
In a tale of two teams, Jewmarr Chase obliterated Herbert Fully Loaded, outscoring them **209.69 to 171.93**. Ouch! It wasn't even close‚Äîthe only suspense was whether Herbert's squad would break 150 points. Spoiler: They didn't.

## **Heartbreaker: For Love or the Chase?**
For those who spent their weekend glued to **For Love or the Chase?**‚Äôs match, it was a rollercoaster of emotions. Rhamondre Stevenson had a decent showing with **14.3 points**, but the team still crumbled to my gochu is dak dak, who edged them out **146.47 to 156.97**. Cue the sad music!

## **Bench Oops: Warrening, Bowers**
Warrening, Bowers had a big ‚Äúwhat if‚Äù moment as they decided to bench Jacory Croskey-Merritt, who racked up **29 points**. Just a gentle reminder that having a quarterback is cool, but having someone who scores is cooler!

## **Trade Fallout: For Love or the Chase?**
In a twist of fate, Kareem Hunt scored **Kareem Hunt-sized** points for chAmi after being picked up off waivers. Not quite the trade of the century, but hey, he didn't hurt them, right? 

## **Waiver Gem: Cardiac Cats Are Back**
The waivers kicked in nicely for the Cardiac Cats as they picked up the Pittsburgh Steelers' defense. They turned out to be a solid choice, bringing in more than just a conservative paycheck to the squad.

So there you have it‚Äîweek 5's hits, misses, and the metric tons of fantasy dramatics we love to see. Until next week, keep those trade offers coming and remember: wait, do you really need that second tight end? üèà
